# Express Static Cache [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/expressjs/express-static-cache.png)](https://travis-ci.org/expressjs/express-static-cache)

Static server for express.
Caches files' metadata in memory.
Optionally store the memory as well - streams by default.
There is no directory or `index.html` support.

## API

### staticCache(dir, options)

```js
var path = require('path')
var staticCache = require('express-static-cache')

app.use(staticCache(path.join(__dirname, 'public')), {
  maxAge: 365 * 24 * 60 * 60
})
```

`dir` - the directory you wish to serve.
`options.maxAge` - cache control max age for the files, `0` by default.
`options.buffer` - store the files in memory instead of streaming from the filesystem on each request.
